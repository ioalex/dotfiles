[`kitty`](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) is a fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal emulator. kitty is designed for power keyboard users. To that end all its controls work with the keyboard (although it fully supports mouse interactions as well). Its configuration is a simple, human editable, single file for easy reproducibility.

This package installs my personal configuration for the `kitty` terminal emulator.
