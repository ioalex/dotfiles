[`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, `ripgrep` will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.

This package installs my personal configuration for `ripgrep`.
