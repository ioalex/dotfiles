[`neofetch`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) is a command-line system information tool written in bash 3.2+. Neofetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

This package installs my personal configuration for `neofetch`.

I change the image (used in the output) when I get bored of it.
