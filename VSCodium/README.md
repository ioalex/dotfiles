[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft's editor [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This package installs my personal settings and keybindings for VSCodium. These settings are written in JSON and can also be used with VSCode.
