[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.

This package sets-up `fzf` by appending the fzf binary into `$PATH`, as well as loads auto-completions and key-bindings.
