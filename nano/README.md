GNU [`nano`](https://www.nano-editor.org/) is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. It was designed to be a free replacement for the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email suite from The University of Washington. It aimed to "emulate Pico as closely as is reasonable and then include extra functionality".

This package installs ensures `nano` is using [@scopatz's Improved Nano Syntax Highlighting Files](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc).
