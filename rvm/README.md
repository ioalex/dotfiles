[Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/) or `rvm` is a command line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

This package installs my personal configuration for `rvm`. As of current, the file only sets the location of `rvm_path` to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rvm`, which allows me to de-clutter my `$HOME` directory.
