[`tealdeer`](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer) is an implementation of `tldr` in Rust. `tldr` is a collection of community-maintained help pages for various command line tools that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional `man` pages.

This package installs sane defaults for `tealdeer` as well as set the colours scheme for the pages.
