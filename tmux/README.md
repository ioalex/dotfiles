[`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer; it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

This package installs sane defaults for `tmux` as well as plugins that are managed by [Tmux Plugin Manager (`tpm`)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).
